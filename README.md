## Clone Repository

https://github.com/DerrickConway/Emerging-Technologies

Go to my github, the link is above, clone or download the repository.

Copy the URL.

https://github.com/DerrickConway/Emerging-Technologies.git

Open a command prompt and cd to your preffered location and do a git clone.

## run project

when you have the downloads completed and clone repositry done navigate to the folder directory.
once in the directory folder cd into the first notebook named '1. Numpy-Notebook'
and run the following command.

> jupyter notebook

It will open a tab in chrome and have a folder should appear click into it, when in it click on kernel 
and restart and run. you will be able to run the notebook.

Do the same for '2. Iris-Dataset-Notebook' and '3.MNIST-Dataset-Notebook'

To run the python scripy navigate to the folder '4.Digit-Rocognition-Script' and run the following command

> python digitrec.py

it will run the script and display the image and save to the folder.
